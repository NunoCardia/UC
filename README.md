# UC
a c99 compiler for the compilers subject

This project consists of the development of a compiler for the UC language, which is a subset of the C language (according to standard C99).
In the UC language it is possible to use variables and literals of type char, short, int, and double (all with sign). The UC language includes arithmetic and logical expressions, assignment statements, relational operators, and control statements (if-else and while). It also includes functions with the data types already mentioned, with parameter passing always done by value.

Based on http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/docs/n1256.pdf with some exceptions
